<h1> Wireshark Dual VM Analysis Project</h1>

<h2>Description: </h2>
<h4>This project will include two VMs: ![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-orange?style=flat-square&logo=ubuntu) and ![Kali Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kali_Linux-blue?style=flat-square&logo=kalilinux) (You don't have to specifically use these 2!). Using these 2 VMs, I will be able to use Wireshark to analyze different kinds of network traffic between each other.</h4>
